"Authentication, access control and scalability models in Internet of Things Security–A review","© 2024The Internet of Things (IoT) leads to the next phase of human interaction with technology. With the help of the IoT, physical objects can be given the ability to generate, receive, and seamlessly trade data with one another. The IoT includes a wide variety of applications, each of which focuses on automating a specific task and works to give inanimate objects the ability to act independently of human intervention. The currently available and upcoming IoT applications hold a great deal of promise for enhancing the level of convenience, productivity, and automation enjoyed by users. High levels of security, privacy, authentication, and the ability to recover from attacks are required for the implementation of such a world in a manner that is constantly expanding. In this light, it is necessary to make the necessary adjustments to the architecture of IoT applications to accomplish end-to-end security in IoT environments. In this article, a comprehensive review of the security-related challenges and potential sources of danger posed by IoT applications is provided. Following a discussion of security concerns, a variety of new and established technologies that are focused on achieving a high degree of trust in the applications of the IoT are covered. Machine learning, fog computing, edge computing, and blockchain are just a few of the technologies that help the IoT provide greater security.",2024-05-01,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Authentication schemes'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Blockchain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Data Security'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Edge computing'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Internet of Things'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Scalability'}]"
Securing IoT devices with fast and energy efficient implementation of PRIDE and PRESENT ciphers,"© 2024The rise of low-power, cost-efficient internet-connected devices has led to a need for lightweight cryptography. The lightweight block cipher PRIDE, designed by Martin R. Albrecht, is one of the most efficient ciphers designed for IoT-constrained environments. It is useful for connected devices, requires fewer resources to implement, and has high performance. PRIDE is a software-oriented lightweight cipher optimized for microcontrollers. This paper focuses on the FPGA implementation of the PRIDE cipher by keeping throughput, energy, and power consumption metrics focused. The paper also presents a novel and simpler diagrammatical view of a Matrix Layer implementation of the PRIDE cipher. We also implemented the PRESENT cipher using the same metrics. We analyzed different design metrics on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and compared the metrics of the PRIDE implementation with the well-known cipher PRESENT. This gives us an insight into the efficiency and reliability of PRIDE in IoT-constrained environments. We also proposed different architectures of the PRIDE cipher for 16-bit and 32-bit datapaths.",2024-04-30,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Encryption Algorithm'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'FPGA Implementation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Internet of Things'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'IoT Security'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Lightweight Cipher'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'PRESENT Cipher'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'PRIDE Cipher'}]"
Perspectives on label-free microscopy of heterogeneous and dynamic biological systems,"© 2024 The Authors.Significance: Advancements in label-free microscopy could provide real-time, non-invasive imaging with unique sources of contrast and automated standardized analysis to characterize heterogeneous and dynamic biological processes. These tools would overcome challenges with widely used methods that are destructive (e.g., histology, flow cytometry) or lack cellular resolution (e.g., plate-based assays, whole animal bioluminescence imaging). Aim: This perspective aims to (1) justify the need for label-free microscopy to track heterogeneous cellular functions over time and space within unperturbed systems and (2) recommend improvements regarding instrumentation, image analysis, and image interpretation to address these needs. Approach: Three key research areas (cancer research, autoimmune disease, and tissue and cell engineering) are considered to support the need for label-free microscopy to characterize heterogeneity and dynamics within biological systems. Based on the strengths (e.g., multiple sources of molecular contrast, non-invasive monitoring) and weaknesses (e.g., imaging depth, image interpretation) of several label-free microscopy modalities, improvements for future imaging systems are recommended. Conclusion: Improvements in instrumentation including strategies that increase resolution and imaging speed, standardization and centralization of image analysis tools, and robust data validation and interpretation will expand the applications of label-free microscopy to study heterogeneous and dynamic biological systems.",2024-03-12,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'artificial intelligence'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'cell dynamics'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'heterogeneity'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'label-free'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'microscopy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'open-source software'}]"
Removal of arsenic from water by silver nanoparticles and Fe-Ce mixed oxide supported on polymeric anion exchanger,"© 2024By encapsulating nanoscale particles of goethite (α-FeO(OH)), hydrous ceric oxide (CeO2·H2O, HCO) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the pores of polystyrene anion exchanger D201, a novel nanocomposite FeO(OH)-HCO-Ag-D201 was prepared for the effective removal of arsenic from water. The isotherm study shows that FeO(OH)-HCO-Ag-D201 has excellent adsorption performance for As(III) and As(V), with an increased adsorption capacity of As(III) to 40.12 mg/g compared to that of 22.03 mg/g by the composite adsorbent without AgNPs (FeO(OH)-HCO-D201). The adsorption kinetics data showed that the sorption rate of FeO(OH)-HCO-Ag-D201 for As(III) is less than that for As(V), and the adsorption of As(III) and As(V) were consistent with the pseudo-second-order model and the pseudo-first-order model, respectively. Neutral or basic conditions are favored for the adsorption of As(III/V) by FeO(OH)-HCO-Ag-D201. Compared with nitrate/chloride/bicarbonate, sulfate/silicate/phosphate showed more remarkable inhibition of arsenic removal by FeO(OH)-HCO-Ag-D201, whereas natural organic matter showed no interference to the arsenic removal. The As(V) adsorption involved different interactions such as electrostatic attraction and surface complexation, while the adsorption of As(III) involved the part oxidization of As(III) to As(V) and the simultaneous adsorption of As(III) and As(V). In addition to the Ce(IV) in CeO2·H2O acted as an oxidant, the synergistic effect of α-FeO(OH) and AgNPs also contributed to the oxidization of As(III) to As(V). Moreover, the reusable property suggested that this FeO(OH)-HCO-Ag-D201 nanocomposite has great potential for arsenic-contaminated water purification.",2024-05-07,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Arsenic removal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Electrostatic attraction'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'FeO(OH)-HCO-Ag-D201'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Oxidation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Surface complexation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Synergistic effect'}]"
Stable partial nitrification was achieved for nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater by gel immobilization: A pilot-scale study,"© 2024As an energy and carbon saving process for nitrogen removal from wastewater, the partial nitrification and denitrification process (PN/D) has been extensively researched. However, achieving stable PN in municipal wastewater has always been challenging. In this study, a gel immobilized PN/D nitrogen removal process (GI-PN/D) was established. A 94d pilot-scale experiment was conducted using real municipal wastewater with an ammonia concentration of 43.5 ± 5.3 mg N/L at a temperature range of 11.3–28.7℃. The nitrogen removal performance and associated pathways, shifts in the microbial community as well as sludge yield were investigated. The results were as follows: the effluent TN and COD were 0.6 ± 0.4 mg/L and 31.1 ± 3.8 mg/L respectively, and the NAR exceeding 95 %. GI-PN/D achieved deep nitrogen removal of municipal wastewater through stable PN without taking any other measures. The primary pathways for nitrogen removal were identified as denitrification, simultaneous nitrification-denitrification, and aerobic denitrification. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the immobilized fillers facilitated the autonomous enrichment of functional bacteria in each reactor, effectively promoting the dominance and stability of the microbial communities. In addition, GI-PN/D had the characteristic of low sludge yield, with an average sludge yield of 0.029 kg SS/kg COD. This study provides an effective technical for nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater through PN.",2024-05-06,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Autonomous enrichment'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Deep nitrogen removal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Gel immobilization'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Partial nitrification'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Sludge yield'}]"
High summer background O3 levels in the desert of northwest China,"© 2024Generally speaking, the precursors of ozone (O3), nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds are very low in desert areas due to the lack of anthropogenic emissions and natural emissions, and thus O3 concentrations are relatively low. However, high summer background concentrations of about 100 µg/m3 or 60 ppb were found in the Alxa Desert in the highland of northwest China based on continuous summer observations from 2019 to 2021, which was higher than the most of natural background areas or clean areas in world for summer O3 background concentrations. The high O3 background concentrations were related to surface features and altitude. Heavy-intensity anthropogenic activity areas in desert areas can cause increased O3 concentrations or pollution, but also generated O3 depleting substances such as nitrous oxide, which eventually reduced the regional O3 baseline values. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) also had a dual effect on O3 generation, showing promotion at low concentrations and inhibition at high concentrations. In addition, sand-dust weather reduced O3 clearly, but O3 eventually stabilized around the background concentration values and did not vary with sand-dust particulate matter.",2024-05-08,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Alxa Desert'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Anthropogenic effect'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Northwest China'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'O3 background concentration'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Sand-dust weather'}]"
Copper-catalyzed C–C bond cleavage coupling with C[tbnd]N bond formation toward mild synthesis of lignin-based benzonitriles,"© 2024N-participated lignin depolymerization is of great importance for the transformation of waste lignin into value-added chemicals. The vast majority of developed strategies employ organic amines as nitrogen source, and considerable methods rely on excessive use of strong base, which suffers severe environmental issues. Herein, benzonitrile derivatives are synthesized from oxidized lignin β-O-4 model compounds in the presence of solid nitrogen source (NH4)2CO3 under mild, base-free conditions over commercially available copper catalyst. Mechanism studies suggest the transformation undergoes a one-pot, highly coupled cascade reaction path involving oxidative C-C bond cleavage and in-situ formation of C[tbnd]N bond. Of which, Cu(OAc)2 catalyzes the transfer of hydrogen from Cβ (Cβ-H) to Cα, leading to the cleavage of Cα-Cβ bonds to offer benzaldehyde derivative, this intermediate then reacts in-situ with (NH4)2CO3 to afford the targeted aromatic nitrile product. Tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), acting as a promoter, plays a key role in breaking the Cα-Cβ bonds to form the intermediate benzaldehyde derivative. With this protocol, the feasibility of the production of value-added syringonitrile from birchwood lignin has been demonstrated. This transformation provides a sustainable approach to benzonitrile chemicals from renewable source of lignin.",2024-05-06,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Benzonitrile derivatives'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Copper catalyst'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Lignin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Mild conditions'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'β-O-4 model compounds'}]"
Current research status on the distribution and transport of micro(nano)plastics in hyporheic zones and groundwater,"© 2024Micro(nano)plastics, as an emerging environmental pollutant, are gradually discovered in hyporheic zones and groundwater worldwide. Recent studies have focused on the origin and spatial/temporal distribution of micro(nano)plastics in regional groundwater, together with the influence of their properties and effects of environmental factors on their transport. However, the transport of micro(nano)plastics in the whole hyporheic zone-groundwater system and the behavior of co-existing substances still lack a complete theoretical interpretation. To provide systematic theoretical support for that, this review summarizes the current pollution status of micro(nano)plastics in the hyporheic zone-groundwater system, provides a comprehensive introduction of their sources and fate, and classifies the transport mechanisms into mechanical transport, physicochemical transport and biological processes assisted transport from the perspectives of mechanical stress, physicochemical reactions, and bioturbation, respectively. Ultimately, this review proposes to advance the understanding of the multi-dimensional hydrosphere transport of micro(nano)plastics centered on groundwater, the microorganisms-mediated synergistic transformation and co-transport involving the intertidal circulation. Overall, this review systematically dissects the presence and transport cycles of micro(nano)plastics within the hyporheic zone-groundwater system and proposes prospects for future studies based on the limitations of current studies.",2024-05-02,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Abundance'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Groundwater'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Hyporheic zone'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Micro(nano)plastics'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Transport mechanisms'}]"
Conversion of N-doped biochar from carotenoid-extracted Tetraselmis suecica and its application to produce supercapacitors,"© 2024Microalgae are one of the promising feedstocks for biorefinery, contributing significantly to net-zero emissions through carbon capture and utilization. However, the disposal of microalgal byproducts from the manufacturing process causes additional environmental pollution, thus, a new application strategy is required. In this study, the Tetraselmis suecica byproduct from the carotenoid extraction process was carbonized and converted into biochar. The converted biochar was proved to be nitrogen-doped biochar (NDB), up to 4.69%, with a specific surface area of 206.59 m2/g and was used as an electrode for a supercapacitor. The NDB electrode (NDB-E) in half-cell showed a maximum specific capacitance of 191 F/g. In a full-cell test, the NDB-E exhibited a high energy density of 7.396 Wh/kg and a high-power density of 18,100 W/kg, and maintained specific capacity of 95.5% after charge and discharge of 10,000 cycles. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the carotenoid-extracted microalgal byproducts are a useful resource for the supercapacitor production. This approach is the first to convert T. suecica into active materials for supercapacitors.",2024-05-02,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Carbonization'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Microalgae'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'N-doped biochar'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Supercapacitor'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Tetraselmis suecica'}]"
Interannual succession of phytoplankton community in a canyon-shaped drinking water reservoir during the initial impoundment period: Taxonomic versus functional groups,"© 2024During the initial impoundment period of a canyon-shaped reservoir, the water body fluctuated violently regarding water level, hydrological condition, and thermal stratification. These variations may alter the structure of phytoplankton community, resulting in algal blooms and seriously threatening the ecological security of the reservoir. It is of great significance to understand the continuous changes of phytoplankton in the initial impoundment period for the protection of reservoir water quality. Therefore, a two-year in-situ monitoring study was conducted on water quality and phytoplankton in a representative canyon-shaped reservoir named Sanhekou and the interannual changes of phytoplankton community and its response to environmental changes during the initial impoundment period were discussed at taxonomic versus functional classification levels. The results showed that the total nitrogen and permanganate index levels were relatively high in the first year due to rapid water storage and heavy rainfall input, and the more stable hydrological conditions in the second year promoted the increase of algae density and the transformation of community, and the proportion of cyanobacteria increased significantly. The succession order of phytoplankton in the first year of the initial impoundment period was Chlorophyta-Bacillariophyta-Chlorophyta, or J/F/X1-P/MP/W1-A/X1/MP, respectively. And the succession order in the second year was Cyanobacteria/Chlorophyta-Bacillariophyta-Chlorophyta, or LM/G/P-P/A/X1-X1/J/G. Water temperature, relative water column stability, mixing depth, and pH were crucial factors affecting phytoplankton community succession. This study revealed the interannual succession law and driving factors of phytoplankton in the initial impoundment period and provided an important reference for the operation management and ecological protection of canyon-shaped reservoirs.",2024-05-02,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Canyon-shaped reservoir'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Functional groups'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Initial impoundment'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Interannual succession'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Water quality'}]"
Impact of aerosol-radiation interaction and heterogeneous chemistry on the winter decreasing PM2.5 and increasing O3 in Eastern China 2014–2020,"© 2024In the context of the prevalent winter air quality issues in China marked by declining PM2.5 and rising O3, this study employed a modified WRF-Chem model to examine the aerosol radiation interaction (ARI), heterogeneous chemistry (AHC), and their combined impact (ALL) on the variations in O3 and PM2.5 during the 2014–2020 in eastern China. Our analysis confirmed that ARI curtailed O3 while elevating PM2.5. AHC reduced O3 through heterogeneous absorption of NOx and hydroxides while notably fostering fine-grained sulfate, resulting in a PM2.5 increase. Emission reductions mitigated the inhibitory impact of ARI on meteorological fields and photolysis rates. Emission reduction individually without aerosol feedback led to a 5.43 ppb O3 increase and a 22.89 µg/m3 PM2.5 decrease. ARI and AHC amplified the emission-reduction-induced (ERI) O3 rise by 1.83 and 0.31 ppb, respectively. The response of ARI to emission diminution brought about a modest PM2.5 increase of 0.31 µg/m3. Conversely, AHC, acting as the primary contributor, caused a noteworthy PM2.5 decrease of 4.60 µg/m3. As efforts concentrate on reducing PM2.5, the promotion of ARI on PM2.5 counterbalanced the efficacy of emission reduction and the AHC-induced strengthening of PM2.5 decrease. The ALL magnified the ERI O3 increase by 38.9% and PM2.5 decrease by 18.7%. Sensitivity experiments with different degrees of emission reduction demonstrated a consistent linear relationship between the ALL-induced enhancement of O3 increase and PM2.5 decrease to the ERI PM2.5 decline. Our investigation revealed the complex connection between emissions and aerosol feedback in influencing air quality.",2024-05-02,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Aerosol-radiation interaction'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Emission reduction'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Heterogeneous chemistry'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'O3 increase'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'PM2.5 decrease'}]"
High potential in synergizing the reduction of dissolved organic carbon concentration and carbon dioxide emissions for submerged-vegetation-covered river networks,"© 2024Various technologies and projects have been explored and developed for the synergetic control of environmental pollution and carbon emissions in aquatic ecosystems. Planting submerged vegetation in shallow waters was also expected to achieve this purpose. However, the magnitude and mechanism of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission affected by submerged vegetation is not clear enough in complex aquatic ecosystems. This study investigated the influences of submerged plants on CO2 emission, ecosystem metabolism features, and microbial community traits based on observations in river networks on the Changjiang River Delta. The results showed that CO2 emission from planted waters accounted for 73% of unplanted waters. Meanwhile, planted waters had higher dissolved organic carbon removal capacity in overlying water and higher potential of carbon sequestration in sediment at the same time. These distinctions between the two habitats were attributed to (1) improved CO2 and bicarbonate consumption in water columns via enhancing photosynthesis and (2) inhibited CO2 production by reconstructing the benthic microbial community. Additional eco-advantages were found in planted sediments, such as a high potential of methane oxidation and xenobiotics biodegradation and a low risk of becoming black and odorous. In brief, submerged vegetation is beneficial in promoting pollution removal and carbon retention synchronously. This study advances our understanding of the feedback between aquatic metabolism and CO2 emission.",2024-04-28,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Carbon uptake velocity'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Microbial metabolism pathways'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Mitigated CO2 emission'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Paired O2 - CO2 departure'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Submerged vegetation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'The Changjiang River'}]"
The influence mechanism of environmental factors on DGT adsorbing sulfonamides and the migration between water and sediment,"© 2024Obtaining the sulfonamides (SAs) concentrations in the water body and sediment bulk was a prerequisite to reveal their transport and partitioning behavior in sediment-water environments and accurately assess their ecological risk. In the present study, the influences of multifactor interactions on the performance of o-DGTs with XAD-18 binding gels were analyzed by central combination experiments and response surfaces analysis, in which the target compounds were 9 SAs. The results indicated that dissolved organic matter (DOM), pH, and suspended particulate matter (SS) had significant effects on the o-DGT sampling, whereas this o-DGT was independent of the ionic strength (IS). Concentning the composite influence of the four factors, the interaction between DOM and SS posed the most significant effect on all 9 SAs compounds. Subsequently, an o-DGT and DIFS model was applied to explore the SAs migration between the water-sediments interface. The difference between desorption rate (kb) and adsorption rates (kf) values suggested that the kinetics of SAs was dominated by adsorption. Moreover, the short-term sediment-water partitioning of SAs was clarified on the basis of distribution coefficient (Kdl) for the labile SAs, among which the sulfadiazine (SDZ) had the largest labile pool. The ability of sediments to release SAs to the liquid phase as a sink was determined by response time (Tc). Among the 9 SAs, the long-term release of soseulfamethoxypyridazine (SMP) from the solid phase of sediments would have a potential risk to the aquatic environment, to which more attention should be paid in the future.",2024-05-06,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'DIFS'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Distribution'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'O-DGT'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Sulfonamides'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Water-sediments interface'}]"
Pilot-scale testing on catalytic hydrolysis of carbonyl sulfur combined with absorption-oxidation of H2S for blast furnace gas purification,"© 2024About 70 % of the flue gas in the iron-steel industry has achieved multi-pollutant ultra-low emissions in China until 2023, and then the blast furnace gas purification has become the control step and bottleneck. Our research group has designed and constructed the world's first blast furnace gas desulfurization pilot plant with the scale of 2000 Nm3/h in October 2021. The pilot plant is a two-step combined desulfurization device including catalytic hydrolysis of carbonyl sulfur (COS) and absorption-oxidation of H2S, continuously running for 120 days. In the hydrolysis system, one reason for catalyst deactivation has been verified from the sulfur deposition. HCN in blast furnace gas can be hydrolyzed on the hydrolysis catalyst to produce the nitrogen deposition, which is one of the reasons for catalyst deactivation and has never been found in previous studies. The deposition forms of S and N elements are determined, S element forms elemental sulfur and sulfate, while N element forms -NH2 and NH4+. In the absorption-oxidation system, the O2 loading and the residence time have been optimized to control the oxidation of HS− to produce elemental sulfur instead of by-product S2O32−. The balance and distribution of S and N elements have been calculated for the whole multi-phase system, approximately 84.4 % of the sulfur is converted to solid sulfur product, about 1.3 % of the sulfur and 19.2 % of N element are deposited on the hydrolysis catalyst. The pilot plant provides technical support for multi-pollutant control of blast furnace.",2024-05-07,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Activated carbon'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Blast furnace gas'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Carbonyl sulfur'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Hydrogen cyanide'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Hydrogen sulfide'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Hydrolysis and oxidation'}]"
"Research progress on secondary formation, photosensitive reaction mechanism and human health effects of chromophoric brown carbon","© 2024Brown carbon (BrC) has attracted widespread attention because of its strong absorption of solar radiation in the ultraviolet-visible wavelength range, which causes adverse impacts on human health. Originally, BrC was a physically defined class of substances. However, current research has gradually shifted towards the identification of its chemical groups, because its light-absorbing capability, chemical properties and health effects mainly depend on the chemical composition of its chromophores. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the chemical understanding of BrC based on chromophores, and the secondary formation mechanism of chromophores, photosensitized reactions, and human health effects of BrC were detailly summarized. Firstly, BrC chromophores are divided into five categories: nitrogen-heterocycles, nitrogen-chain, aromatic species, oligomers and sulfur-containing organic compounds. Different chromophore precursor species exhibit variations, and their formation mechanisms are also distinct. Secondly, BrC can trigger the production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors or cause SOA growth because BrC is an important component of light-absorbing particles formed during incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels, potentially exerting adverse effects on human health. Finally, developing sufficiently separated methods for BrC and refining algorithms and machine learning can lead to a more effective understanding of the chemical composition of chromophores, thus enabling better evaluation of the atmospheric effects and health impacts of BrC. In all, this review provides new insights into the categories of BrC chromophores and new advance in secondary formation mechanisms, photosensitized reactions, and human health effects on the basis of chemical structures.",2024-05-06,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Brown carbon'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Constituent characteristics'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Human health effects'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Photosensitive'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Secondary formation mechanism'}]"
"Nighttime reactions of a series of unsaturated alcohols with NO3•: Kinetics, products and mechanisms study","© 2024Unsaturated alcohols are a class of Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted in large quantities by plants when damaged or under adverse environmental conditions, and studies on their atmospheric degradation at night are still lacking. We used chamber experiments to study the gas-phase reactions of three unsaturated alcohols, E-2-penten-1-ol, Z-2-hexen-1-ol and Z-3-hepten-1-ol, with NO3 radicals (NO3•) during the night. The rate constants of these reactions were (11.7 ± 1.76) × 10−13, (8.55 ± 1.33) × 10−13 and (6.08 ± 0.47) × 10−13 cm3/(molecule·s) at 298K and 760 Torr, respectively. In contrast, the reaction rate of similar substances with ozone was about 10−18 cm3/(molecule·s), which indicates that the reaction with NO3• is the main oxidation pathway for unsaturated alcohols at night. Small molecule aldehydes and ketones were the main gas-phase organic products of the reaction of three aldehydes and ketones with NO3•, and the total small molecule aldehydes and ketones yields can reach between 45%-60%. They mainly originate from the breakage of alkoxy radicals, and different breakage sites determine different product distributions. In addition, the SOA yields of the three unsaturated alcohols with NO3• were 7.1% ± 1.0%, 12.5% ± 1.9% and 30.0% ± 4.5%, respectively, which were much higher than those of similarly structured substances with O3 or OH radicals (•OH). The results of high-resolution mass spectrometry shows that the main components of Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) of the three unsaturated alcohols are dimeric compounds containing several nitrate groups, which are formed through the polymerization of oxyalkyl radicals.",2024-05-06,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Aldehyde and ketone products'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Reaction mechanism'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Reaction rate'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Secondary organic aerosol components'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Unsaturated alcohols'}]"
Civil aviation emissions in China in 2019: Characteristics and abatement potential,"© 2024Civil aviation is one of the industries facing the greatest challenge in reaching carbon neutrality by the middle of this century, and this sector also contributes to adverse impacts on the regional air quality and human health. China exhibits the second highest air passenger turnover worldwide. Our understanding of civil aviation emissions must be urgently enhanced, and the mitigation potential should be explored. In this study, on the basis of real domestic flight information for 2019, we built a greenhouse gas and air pollution emission inventory for the civil aviation sector in China with the fuel flow method based on the cruise and other phases. We thoroughly analyzed emissions by region, aircraft and engine types, and aircraft age, based on which we designed four measures to evaluate the abatement potential. We found that the hydrocarbon (HC), CO, NOx, SO2, particulate matter (PM) and CO2 emissions in 2019 reached 79.9 kt (95% CI [51.6–114.5]), 176.3 kt (95% CI [114.5–248.2]), 304.2 kt (95% CI [203.4–420.7]), 23.2 kt (95% CI [14.2–33.7]), 1.0 kt (95% CI [0.61–1.44]) and 87.0 Mt (95% CI [57.4–119.6]), respectively. The cruise phase was the major emission phase, accounting for 67%-87% of the total pollutant emissions. If four measures were jointly implemented, the HC, CO, NOx, SO2, PM and CO2 emissions could be reduced by 61%, 54%, 55%, 45%, 32% and 38%, respectively. Utilizing lower-emission aircraft and switching travel modes could substantially reduce civil aviation emissions in China.",2024-05-06,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Age structure'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Cruise emission'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Emission inventory'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Fuel flow method'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Reduction measures'}]"
"Kinetics of the reaction of OH radical with ethylfluoroacetate, ethyl 4,4,4-trifluorobutyrate, and butylfluoroacetate","© 2024Kinetics of the gas-phase reactions of •OH radicals with a series of fluoroesters were studied for the first time at 298 ± 3 K and atmospheric pressure. Relative rate coefficients were determined by in situ FTIR spectroscopy in nitrogen and GC-FID in air to monitor the decay of reactants and references. The following coefficient values (in 10−12 cm3/(molecule•sec)) were obtained for ethyl fluoroacetate (EFA), ethyl 4,4,4-trifluorobutyrate (ETB), and butyl fluoroacetate (BFA), respectively: k1 (EFA + OH) = 1.15 ± 0.25 by FTIR and 1.34 ± 0.23 by GC-FID; k2 (ETB + OH) = 1.61 ± 0.36 by FTIR and 2.02 ± 0.30 by GC-FID; k3 (BFA + OH) = 2.24 ± 0.37 by FTIR. Reactivity trends were developed and correlated with the number of CH3 and F substituents in the fluoroester, and structure-activity relationships (SARs) calculations were performed. In addition, the tropospheric lifetimes of EFA, ETB, and BFA upon degradation by OH radicals were calculated to be 9, 6, and 5 days, respectively, indicating that these fluorinated compounds could have a possible regional effect from the emission source. Relatively small photochemical ozone creation potentials of 9, 7, and 19 were estimated for EFA, ETB, and BFA, respectively. The Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) for EFA, ETB, and BFA were calculated for different time horizons. For a 20-year time horizon, the GWPs were 1.393, 0.063, and 0.062, respectively. In the case of a 100-year time horizon, the GWPs were 0.379, 0.017, and 0.017, and for a 500-year time horizon, the GWPs were 0.108, 0.005, and 0.005 for EFA, ETB, and BFA.",2024-05-06,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Acidification potentials'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'CFC replacements sinks'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Greenhouse gases'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'in situ FTIR'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'SAR'}]"
Quantitative analysis of influencing factors to aerosol pH and its responses to PM2.5 and O3 pollution in a coastal city,"© 2024Aerosol acidity (pH) plays an important role in the multiphase chemical processes of atmospheric particles. In this study, we demonstrated the seasonal trends of aerosol pH calculated with the ISORROPIA-II model in a coastal city of southeast China. We performed quantitative analysis on the various influencing factors on aerosol pH, and explored the responses of aerosol pH to different PM2.5 and O3 pollution levels. The results showed that the average aerosol pH was 2.92 ± 0.61, following the order of winter > spring > summer > autumn. Sensitivity tests revealed that SO42−, NHx, T and RH triggered the variations of aerosol pH. Quantitative analysis results showed that T (37.9%-51.2%) was the main factors affecting pH variations in four seasons, followed by SO42− (6.1%-23.7%), NHx (7.2%-22.2%) and RH (0–14.2%). Totally, annual mean meteorological factors (52.9%) and chemical compositions (41.3%) commonly contributed the aerosol ΔpH in the coastal city. The concentrations of PM2.5 was positively correlated with aerosol liquid water content (R2 = 0.53) and aerosol pH (R2 = 0.26), indicating that the increase in pH was related with the elevated NH4NO3 and decreased SO42−, and also the changes of T and RH. The Ox (O3 + NO2) was moderately correlated with aerosol pH (R2 = -0.48), attributable to the fact that the proportion of SO42− increased under high T and low RH conditions. The study strengthened our understanding of the contributions of influencing factors to aerosol pH, and also provided scientific evidences for chemical processes of atmospheric particles in coastal areas.",2024-05-06,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Aerosol acidity'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Aerosol liquid water'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Coastal city'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Fine particular matter (PM2.5)'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Ozone (O3)'}]"
Development of an automated photolysis rates prediction system based on machine learning,"© 2024Based on observed meteorological elements, photolysis rates (J-values) and pollutant concentrations, an automated J-values predicting system by machine learning (J-ML) has been developed to reproduce and predict the J-values of O1D, NO2, HONO, H2O2, HCHO, and NO3, which are the crucial values for the prediction of the atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) and secondary pollutant concentrations such as ozone (O3), secondary organic aerosols (SOA). The J-ML can self-select the optimal “Model + Hyperparameters” without human interference. The evaluated results showed that the J-ML had a good performance to reproduce the J-values where most of the correlation (R) coefficients exceed 0.93 and the accuracy (P) values are in the range of 0.68-0.83, comparing with the J-values from observations and from the tropospheric ultraviolet and visible (TUV) radiation model in Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Shanghai. The hourly prediction was also well performed with R from 0.78 to 0.81 for next 3-days and from 0.69 to 0.71 for next 7-days, respectively. Compared with O3 concentrations by using J-values from the TUV model, an emission-driven observation-based model (e-OBM) by using the J-values from the J-ML showed a 4%-12% increase in R and 4%-30% decrease in ME, indicating that the J-ML could be used as an excellent supplement to traditional numerical models. The feature importance analysis concluded that the key influential parameter was the surface solar downwards radiation for all J-values, and the other dominant factors for all J-values were 2-m mean temperature, O3, total cloud cover, boundary layer height, relative humidity and surface pressure.",2024-05-06,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Automated prediction system'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'J-values'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Machine learning'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'O3 simulated improvement'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Short-term prediction'}]"
Effect of Cu/HZSM-5 sorbents with different Si/Al ratios on the adsorption and oxidation performance of H2S,"© 2024This study employed a wet impregnation method to synthesize five types of Cu/HZSM-5 adsorbents with Si/Al ratios of 25, 50, 85, 200, and 300, used for the removal of H2S in low-temperature, low-oxygen environments. The impact of different Si/Al ratios on the adsorption oxidative performance of Cu30/HZSM-5–85 adsorbents was investigated. According to the performance test results, Cu30/HZSM-5–85 exhibited the highest breakthrough capacity, reaching 231.75 mg H2S/gsorbent. Cu/HZSM-5 sorbent maintains a strong ability to remove H2S even under humid conditions and shows excellent water resistance. XRD, BET, and XPS results revealed that CuO is the primary active species, with Cu30/HZSM-5–85 having the largest surface area and highest CuO content, providing more active sites for H2S adsorption. H2-TPR and O2-TPD results confirmed that Cu30/HZSM-5–85 sorbent exhibits outstanding redox properties and oxygen storage capacity, contributing to excellent oxygen transferability in the molecular sieve adsorption-oxidation process. With notable characteristics such as a large surface area, high desulfurization efficiency, and water resistance, Cu30/HZSM-5–85 sorbents hold significant importance for industrial applications.",2024-05-06,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Adoration-oxidation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Cu/HZSM-5–85(HZSM-5 with Si/Al ratio of 85 loaded Cu)'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'H2S'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Si/Al ratio'}]"
Meteorological effects on sources and future projection of nitrogen deposition to lakes in China,"© 2024Lake ecosystems are extremely sensitive to nitrogen growth, which leads to water quality degradation and ecosystem health decline. Nitrogen depositions, as one of the main sources of nitrogen in water, are expected to change under future climate change scenarios. However, it remains not clear how nitrogen deposition to lakes respond to future meteorological conditions. In this study, a source-oriented version of Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model was used to estimate nitrogen deposition to 263 lakes in 2013 and under three RCP scenarios (4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) in 2046. Annual total deposition of 58.2 Gg nitrogen was predicted for all lakes, with 23.3 Gg N by wet deposition and 34.9 Gg N by dry deposition. Nitrate and ammonium in aerosol phase are the major forms of wet deposition, while NH3 and HNO3 in gas phase are the major forms of dry deposition. Agriculture emissions contribute to 57% of wet deposition and 44% of dry deposition. Under future meteorological conditions, wet deposition is predicted to increase by 5.5% to 16.4%, while dry deposition would decrease by 0.3% to 13.0%. Changes in wind speed, temperature, relative humidity (RH), and precipitation rates are correlated with dry and wet deposition changes. The predicted changes in deposition to lakes driven by meteorological changes can lead to significant changes in aquatic chemistry and ecosystem functions. Apart from future emission scenarios, different climate scenarios should be considered in future ecosystem health evaluation in response to nitrogen deposition.",2024-05-06,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'CMAQ'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Deposition'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Lakes'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Meteorological variations'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Nitrogen'}]"
"Influence of phytoplankton, bacteria and viruses on nutrient supply in tropical waters","© 2024Diel investigations of water environments are one means to holistically understand the dynamics and functional roles of phytoplankton, bacteria and viruses in these ecosystems. They have the potential to substantially impact carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) biogeochemistry through their respective roles. This study characterizes the phytoplankton, bacteria and virus communities and the elemental composition of various C, N and P nutrients flow over three diel cycles in tropical urban lake. Our results show that ratios of C:N:P fluctuated strongly from the lack of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and PO4. Specifically, green algae peaked during day time and exudate dissolved organic matter (DOM) that strongly modulate dissolved organic carbon (DOC):DOP ratio to diel DOP limitation. Multiple linear regression and Stella modelling emphasize the roles of viruses together with Synechococcus as important nutrient recyclers of NH4 and PO4 in nutrients-limited waters. Respective normalised surface PO4 and combined surface and bottom NH4 concentration selected both viruses and Synechococcus as important drivers. Process model of N and P biogeochemical cycles can achieve 69% and 57% similar to observed concentration of NH4 and PO4, respectively. A short latent period of 9 hr was calculated, in addition to the calibrated high infectivity of viruses to Synechococcus. Taken together, the rapid turn-over between Synechococcus and viruses has biogeochemical significance, where the rapid recycling of essential nutrients allows for shortcuts in the N and P cycle, supporting a wide range of microbes.",2024-05-03,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Bacteria'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Diel'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Element ratios'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Nutrients'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Phytoplankton'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Virus'}]"
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi promote functional gene regulation of phosphorus cycling in rhizosphere microorganisms of Iris tectorum under Cr stress,"© 2024The mutualistic symbiotic system formed by clumping arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plants can remediate heavy metal-contaminated soils. However, the specific mechanisms underlying the interaction between AMF and inter-root microbial communities, particularly their impact on organic phosphorus (P) cycling, remain unclear. This study investigated the gene regulation processes involved in inter-root soil phosphorus cycling in wetland plants, specifically Iris tectorum, following inoculation with AMF under varying concentrations of chromium (Cr) stress. Through macro-genome sequencing, we analyzed the composition and structure of the inter-root soil microbial community associated with Iris tectorum under greenhouse pot conditions. The results demonstrated significant changes in the diversity and composition of the inter-root soil microbial community following AMF inoculation, with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes being the dominant taxa. Under Cr stress, species and gene co-occurrence network analysis revealed that AMF promoted the transformation process of organic phosphorus mineralization and facilitated inorganic phosphorus uptake. Additionally, network analysis of functional genes indicated strong aggregation of (pstS, pstA, pstC, TC.PIT, phoR, pp-gppA) genes, which collectively enhanced phosphorus uptake by plants. These findings shed light on the inter-root soil phosphorus cycling process during the co-remediation of Cr-contaminated soil by AMF-Iris tectorum symbiosis, providing valuable theoretical support for the application of AMF-wetland plant symbiosis systems to remediate heavy metal-contaminated soil.",2024-05-03,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Cr'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Iris tectorum'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Metagenome'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Phosphorus'}]"
"Study of spatiotemporal variation and annual emission of CH4 in Shaoxing Yangtze River Delta, China, Using a portable CH4 detector on the UAV","© 2024Methane (CH4) is the second greenhouse gas and has a profound impact on global climate change due to its high global warming potential and concentration. By 2022, the CH4 concentration was approximately 1.9 ppm, which was 264% of the pre-industrial level. The spatiotemporal distribution of CH4 was investigated by a portable CH4 detector on an unmanned aerial vehicle and electric bicycles in Shaoxing, a city situated in the Yangtze River Delta, China. The vertical distribution revealed CH4 concentration generally decreased slowly with height. However, the inversion condition and low atmospheric boundary layer height (ABLH) leaded to the enhancement of CH4 with height. The highest CH4 concentration (2.2 ± 0.1 ppm, n = 1428) was observed in winter and the lowest (2.0 ± 0.2 ppm, n = 1530) in spring. Regarding the daily variation, CH4 concentration peaked at 5:00 local time (LT) and reached its lowest level at 14:00 LT, which was attributed to the daily variation of ABLH, lowest in the early morning and highest in the noon. In urban areas, CH4 concentrations showed higher levels near restaurants, natural gas stations and sewerage well, with a maximum value of 13.1 ppm, which was caused by CH4 emission and natural gas leakage from these places. The annual CH4 emission in Shaoxing were estimated to be approximately 69 ton/(km2·year) by the mass balance approach. Compared with other cities in the world, the CH4 emission is in higher level which imply some control measures should be conducted to reduce CH4 emission in Shaoxing.",2024-05-03,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Annual CH4 emission'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Portable CH4 detector'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Spatiotemporal variation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Unmanned aerial vehicle'}]"
