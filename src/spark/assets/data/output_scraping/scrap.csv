85075752961,Particle-size analysis,"© 1986 by the American Society of Agronomy, Inc.Particle-size analysis (PSA) is a measurement of the size distribution of individual particles in a soil sample. The major features of PSA are the destruction or dispersion of soil aggregates into discrete units by chemical, mechanical, or ultrasonic means and the separation of particles according to size limits by sieving and sedimentation. Soils generally contain organic matter and often contain iron oxides and carbonate coatings that bind particles together. Chemical pretreatments are used for removal of these coatings; however, chemical treatment can result in destruction and dissolution of some soil minerals. In addition to sieving and sedimentation procedures, there are numerous techniques for measurement of particle-size distribution that have been developed for powder technology and other applications. These techniques include optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrical sensory zone (Coulter counter) methods, and light-scattering methods such as laserlight scattering, turbidimeters, holography, and x-ray centrifuges.",2021-07-16,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Carbonate coatings'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Chemical pretreatments'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Electrical sensory zone methods'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Iron oxides'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Optical microscopy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Particle-size analysis'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Powder technology'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Scanning electron microscopy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Soil sample'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Transmission electron microscopy'}]"
85057143501,Minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles 2018 (MISEV2018): a position statement of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles and update of the MISEV2014 guidelines,"© 2018, © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group on behalf of The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles.The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell-released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (“MISEV”) guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these “MISEV2014” guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities. Finally, a checklist is provided with summaries of key points.",2024-05-08,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'ectosomes'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'exosomes'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'extracellular vesicles'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'guidelines'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'microparticles'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'microvesicles'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'minimal information requirements'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'reproducibility'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'rigor'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'standardization'}]"
85084940845,"Total carbon, organic carbon, and organic matter","© 1996 by the Soil Science Society of America, Inc.Total carbon (C) in soils is the sum of both organic and inorganic C. Organic C is present in the soil organic matter fraction, whereas inorganic C is largely found in carbonate minerals. The wet combustion analysis of soils by chromic acid digestion has long been a standard method for determining total C, giving results in good agreement with dry combustion. Methods for total C are basic for many of the procedures used to determine organic C in soils. In contrast to noncalcareous soils, inorganic C must be removed from calcareous or limed soils before the analysis if wet or dry combustion techniques are used to directly measure the organic C present. The organic matter content of soil may be indirectly estimated through multiplication of the organic C concentration by the ratio of organic matter to organic C commonly found in soils.",2022-11-04,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Dry combustion technique'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Inorganic carbon'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Noncalcareous soil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Organic carbon'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Organic matter content'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Soil organic matter'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Total carbon analysis'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wet combustion technique'}]"

85041125468,UFBoot2: Improving the ultrafast bootstrap approximation,"© The Author 2017.The standard bootstrap (SBS), despite being computationally intensive, is widely used in maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses. We recently proposed the ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) to reduce computing time while achievingmore unbiased branch supports than SBS undermildmodel violations. UFBoot has been steadily adopted as an efficient alternative to SBS and other bootstrap approaches. Here, we present UFBoot2, which substantially accelerates UFBoot and reduces the risk of overestimating branch supports due to polytomies or severe model violations. Additionally, UFBoot2 provides suitable bootstrap resampling strategies for phylogenomic data. UFBoot2 is 778 times (median) faster than SBS and 8.4 times (median) faster than RAxML rapid bootstrap on tested data sets. UFBoot2 is implemented in the IQ-TREE software package version 1.6 and freely.",2021-08-13,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'maximum likelihood'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'model violation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'phylogenetic inference'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'polytomies'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'ultrafast bootstrap'}]"

85050262252,Summary of the contents and survey properties,"© ESO 2018.Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. Aims. A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods. The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. Results. Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. Conclusions. Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.",2024-04-22,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Asteroids: general'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Astrometry'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Catalogs'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Minor planets'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Stars: fundamental parameters'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Stars: variables: general'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Techniques: radial velocities'}]"

85051293051,30 Years of Lithium-Ion Batteries,"© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimOver the past 30 years, significant commercial and academic progress has been made on Li-based battery technologies. From the early Li-metal anode iterations to the current commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs), the story of the Li-based battery is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. This review will discuss the main roles of material science in the development of LIBs. As LIB research progresses and the materials of interest change, different emphases on the different subdisciplines of material science are placed. Early works on LIBs focus more on solid state physics whereas near the end of the 20th century, researchers began to focus more on the morphological aspects (surface coating, porosity, size, and shape) of electrode materials. While it is easy to point out which specific cathode and anode materials are currently good candidates for the next-generation of batteries, it is difficult to explain exactly why those are chosen. In this review, for the reader a complete developmental story of LIB should be clearly drawn, along with an explanation of the reasons responsible for the various technological shifts. The review will end with a statement of caution for the current modern battery research along with a brief discussion on beyond lithium-ion battery chemistries.",2024-02-08,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'anode'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'cathode'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'electrolyte'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Li-ion battery'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'lithium metal'}]"

85117926512,"LAMMPS - a flexible simulation tool for particle-based materials modeling at the atomic, meso, and continuum scales","© 2021 The Author(s)Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in LAMMPS are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.

Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The LAMMPS code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel FFTs for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the Størmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, LAMMPS supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features.
